The app focuses on optimizing workflows for shipment handling, goods receipt, vehicle logging, discrepancy management, and seamless integration of custom business rules. It empowers freight companies to efficiently manage operations with precision and transparency.

## Key Features

### 1. Goods Receipt & Shipment Manifest Management

- Provides dynamic handling of customer details, destinations, and item details with real-time updates.

### 2. Left Goods Log
- Manages items left during shipment due to discrepancies in quantity.
- Enables re-shipment of left goods with a single click, creating new shipment manifests.
- Updates statuses (e.g., "Manifest Left" â†’ "Shipped") automatically upon re-shipment.

### 3. Vehicle Log Management
- Maintains detailed records of vehicle movements, linked to shipment manifests.
- Aggregates shipping charges in the parent **Vehicle Log** from child records.
- Provides actionable insights for operational and financial reporting.

### 4. Custom Print Formats
- Dynamic print formats for documents like **Goods Receipts**, **Shipment Manifests**, and **Vehicle Logs**.
- Includes terms and conditions and neatly styled outputs for operational use.

### 5. Custom Scripts for Enhanced Usability

- Handles intricate logic like syncing charges, statuses, and references across related documents.

### 6. Workspace Customization
- Tailored workspaces to provide users with focused and role-specific landing pages.

### 7. Terms and Conditions Management
